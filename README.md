# Stream_Processing_Service
Implementation of a non-blocking stream processing service.
## Install  
This project uses **node** and **npm**. Please install them if you do not have them locally installed.  
## Usage  
Navigate to the project directory and run `npm i && node server.js`.  
Then visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  
## Important notes:
On a Unix OS, run `chmod x+ <filename>`. For example: `chmod x+ ./generator-macosx-amd64`.  
On Mac OS, you need to allow running files from **AppStore and identified developers**.  
* Then when you try and run the program from your terminal, you will get a prompt to allow the execution.  
* Then the **Security & Privacy** window will pop up.  
* Then you can allow the specific executable to run.
